# Excel Analytics Platform

A powerful platform for uploading any Excel file (.xls or .xlsx), analyzing the data, and generating
interactive 2D and 3D charts. Users can select X and Y axes from the column headers of the Excel file,
choose chart types, and generate downloadable graphs. Each user's history of uploads and analysis is saved
and visible on their dashboard. Admin can manage users and data usage. The platform will optionally
integrate AI APIs to provide smart insights or summary reports from the uploaded data
